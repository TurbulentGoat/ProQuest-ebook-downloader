# ProQuest-ebook-downloader
=============================

A Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey userscript that will save each page's image to the browser's storage and export them, in order, to a single PDF when you click export.

Press f12 to monitor the console to ensure it has saved all the pages. 

Do not zoom out all the way as that makes ProQuest load lower res images meaning they save low res. 

Currently only tested with ProQuest.
